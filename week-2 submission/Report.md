## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
2. **Model Training and Prediction**:
3. **Streamlit Integration**:


## Challenges

1. **Could not get good results using each day as an index**
2. **Faced issues calculating p , d , q for arima/sarimax**
3. **Trying to get the most accurate results**

## Results

The application allows users to forecast sales and visualize results with different models. Below are the key evaluation metrics:

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Indicates the average deviation of the predicted sales from the actual sales.
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Represents the accuracy of the model's predictions.
